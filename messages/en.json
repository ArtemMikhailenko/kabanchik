        "question": "How does Services-helper work?",
        "answer": "Post an order or an offer, wait for responses from specialists and choose a performer from those who responded or from top specialists in the category. After the order is completed, leave a review — it helps the community grow and find reliable partners."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Do I have to pay to use the site?",

      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What is the referral program?",
